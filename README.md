# README

This is my CSC 256 repository where I'll be keeping all my assignments, projects, and coursework for this semester. I'm using this space to track how I'm doing in the class and to showcase what I'm learning in QA with everything organized in one place so that I am able to look back and see my progress.

## What This Class Is About

CSC 256 is focused on Software Quality Assurance, which is basically learning how to make sure software actually works properly before it gets released. We're covering all the principles and processes of software testing, including different testing technologies, static techniques, test design techniques, and test management. I'll be working on projects that involve things like Test Driven Development (TDD), API testing, automated testing, and even some DevOps stuff like CI/CD. The goal is to learn how to design and implement proper testing plans throughout the entire software development process, which is super important for any programming job.

## How I'm Organizing Everything

I'm trying to keep this repository oranzinged so that it is easy to navigate through. Each folder will have the code files, any documentation I need to write, and other stuff that goes with each assignment. I'm also going to work on writing good commit messages and using proper version control.

This repository will be like my portfolio by the end of the semester. I can show it to colleges or use it as a reference when I'm working on other coding projects.
